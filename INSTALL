========================
1. Install CSparse
========================
CS)PLSI requires Dr. Timothy Davis's CSparse library. You need to download it 
from:
    http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/CSparse/CSparse.tar.gz

After downloading, follow the installation instructions for CSparse before 
trying to install CS_PLSI.


========================
2. Copy CS_PLSI files to you CSparse directory
========================
a. Configuration files
----------------------
  WARNING: CSparse and CXSparse have different configuration files and options.
           Please follow the instructions for the version you are using.
i. CSparse
----------
If you __have not__ modified your CSparse installation, you can just replace
CSparse/Include/cs.h and CSparse/MATLAB/CSparse/cs_make.c with the appropriate
files in the config/CSparse directory.

If you __have__ modified your CSparse installation, then you need to insert the
following lines at the bottom of CSparse/Include/cs.h (right above all the
#define statements):

/* cs_plsi */
double cs_plsi(const cs *X,        const int K,          const double B, 
               const double *pZin, const double *pWgZin, const double *pDgZin, 
               double *pZout,      double *pWgZout,      double *pDgZout);

And you need to add "cpsli" to the "cs" array (at line 49 in a fresh install)
and to the "csm" array (at line 83 in a fresh install). For example, cs would
look something like this:

cs = { 'cs_add', 'cs_amd',...a bunch of things...,'cs_randperm','cpsli' }

ii. CXSparse
------------
If you __have not__ modified your CXSparse installation, you can just replace
CXSparse/Include/cs.h and CXSparse/MATLAB/CSparse/private/cs_make_helper.c with
the appropriate files in the config/CXSparse directory.

If you __have__ modified your CSparse installation, then you need to insert the
following lines at the approriate places in CXSparse/Include/cs.h 

/* cs_plsi */
double cs_dl_plsi(const cs_dl *X,        const UF_long K,          const double B, 
             const double *pZin, const double *pWgZin, const double *pDgZin, 
             double *pZout,      double *pWgZout,      double *pDgZout);

--- and ---

#define cs_plsi CS_NAME (_plsi)

Also, in CXSparse/MATLAB/CSparse/private/cs_make_helper.m you need to add 
'cs_plsi' to the cs and csm lists.

Currently, installing cs_plsi in CXSparse breaks support for complex matrices for 
everything else. Sorry about that.

b. CS_PLSI files
------------------------
Copy cs_plsi.c to CSparse/Source/ (or CXSparse/Source)
Copy cs_plsi_mex.c and cs_plsi.m to CSparse/MATLAB/CSparse/ (or CXSparse/MATLAB/CSparse)

========================
3. Install CS_PLSI
========================
Launch MATLAB.

If you never ran "cs_install" in step 1, now is the time. In MATLAB, navigate 
to CSparse/MATLAB/ and type "cs_install". This compiles and tests CSparse and 
may take some time. This is also going to install cs_plsi.

If you did follow directions and already ran "cs_install" in step 1, navigate 
to CSparse/MATLAB/CSparse/. Type "cs_make cs_plsi" to install cs_plsi. This may 
fail with CXSparse. If it does, just type cs_install, it should probably fail 
on the first try but work when it disables support for complex matrices. (sorry)

========================
4. Troubleshooting
========================
Q: CSparse won't compile!
A: You might be on a 64 bit system, but CSparse was written for 32 bit systems.
Try using CXSparse, and don't forget to also download UFconfig, because CXSparse
has a dependency on it.
