This is some work I did as part of a research project at the end of my
bachelors studies. There's nothing really new here, just an implementation
of plsi for sparse matrices.

My advisor for the project was Dr. Tim Davis, the creator of many of
MATLAB's sparse matrix algorithms. My project is a small extension of his
library and therefore obviously has a dependency on CSparse/CXSparse.

I haven't touched this code in over a year, so I don't quite remember the
details on how it all works. I've included a demo matlab script to help
anyone get going using this code.

Many thanks to Dr. Tim Davis (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~davis/) for the
help while writing this.

You can see two matrices which I used this on here:
